    <div style="margin-top:40px; color:#D0000C;padding-bottom:20px;"> Factory </div>

    <div style="padding-left:0px;width:auto;">
      In 2018, my wife and I bought an old shoe factory in Paris.
      We entirely demolished and revamped the space.
    </div>
    <div style="text-align: center;">

      We were conscious of the importance of energy insulation. We used
      hemp-based insulation for walls and a double-glass window
      for the facade.
      One thing we did not replace was the roof. We loved the industrial-style
      "verrière" and it was an expensive thing to do.
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top:20px; color:#D0000C;padding-bottom:20px;"> Roof </div>
    <div>
      But soon after, we realized it was a bad decision. Insulating the entire flat except the roof
      led to severe <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_bridge'>thermal bridging</a>.
      During winter, as exterior temperature fell, the glass roof was exposed to cold air from the outside and
      hot air from the inside leading to condensation.
    </div>

    <div style="margin-top: 10px; ">
      In July 2021 we finally were able to replace our old single-glass roof. After one year looking for a capable
      artisan, we installed a double
      glass ceiling roof with thermal break steel from <a
        href="https://www.jansen.com/fr/building-systems-systems-de-profiles-acier/produits.html#/">Jansen</a>. The
      difference in confort was mind boggling. It was like moving in a new flat.</div>

    <div>
      A question I asked myself was: how much energy and CO2 are we saving?
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
      In February 2019, I acquired a <a href='https://www.netatmo.com/fr-fr/energy/thermostat'>Netatmo thermostat</a>
      that controls the heating system. The device collects temperature, boiler activity on a 30min step.
      It has an <a href="https://dev.netatmo.com/apidocumentation/energy">API</a> we can query. See code
      source in <a href="https://github.com/martindaniel4/home_data">Python here</a>.
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
      In July 2020, I also got installed <a
        href="https://www.grdf.fr/particuliers/fonctionnement-compteur-gaz-communicant-grdf">Gazpar</a>, the smart
      gas meter from GRDF (French gas operator). While far from perfect (the data portal is <a
        href='https://twitter.com/martindaniel4/status/1482308908106625025'>often</a> down) it allows me to get
      an accurate daily measure of my energy consumption.
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Below is a line graph plotting <span style="background-color: #4e79a7; padding: 0px 6px;
      border-radius: 4px; color: white">internal temperature</span>, <span style="background-color: #e15759; padding: 0px 6px;
      border-radius: 4px; color: white">exterior
        temperature</span> (°C)
      and <span style="background-color: grey; padding: 0px 6px;
      border-radius: 4px; color: white">energy</span> in Kwh
      between October 2020 and April 2021. Few notes:
      <ul>
        <li>It's pretty chilly in our flat! Average interior temperature is 17.2 °C.</li>
        <li>The colder outside the more energy we consume (duh).</li>
      </ul>

    <div style="margin-top:20px; color:#D0000C;padding-bottom:20px;"> Modeling </div>
    <div>
      In order to measure how much energy we are saving, we need a model. We could for instance compare
      our energy usage with the previous year. But since exterior temperature varies, we be away for the house,
      comparing with the previous year is imprecise.
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
      A good model would be like a "twin" flat. It would show how much energy we would have consumed if we had kept the
      old roof.
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;">
      <img src="img/model.svg"></img>
    </div>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
      To do so I run a good ol' <a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/linreg.htm">linear regression</a>
      with the following inputs:
      <ul>
        <li>Internal temperature (°C)</li>
        <li>Exterior temperature (°C)</li>
        <li>Whether or not the flat is occupied (boolean)</li>
      </ul>
      The model is trained from October 2020 to February 2021 and has a nice fit! We are able to capture 90% of the
      daily energy variance. The graph below displays the <span style="background-color: #a2a5ba; padding: 0px 5px;
      border-radius: 4px; font-weight: 400; color: white">model's predictions
        (dotted
        line)</span> and the <span style="background-color: #5b6187; padding: 0px 5px;
        border-radius: 4px; color: white; font-weight: 400;">true energy consumed (solid line)</span>. Notice that
      the model "holds well" after the training period.

        <img src="img/training_model.svg"></img>
      </div>

      <div>
        We can also look at the coefficients returned by our model in the table below.
        <table style="text-align: left; width: 600px; margin: auto; margin-top: 20px;">

            <td> -9.376</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        The interior and exterior temperature coefficients make sense and can be interpreted as follow:
        <ul>
          <li>Increasing internal temperature by 1°C correlates with a 8Kwh
            increase in energy heat. </li>
          <li>Similarly, when external temperature drop by 1°C, we need 10Kwh of energy to heat the home.</li>
        </ul>
        If you need some order of magnitude: 10Kwh of energy is equivalent to roughly <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4O5voOCqAQ">13 cyclists</a> pedaling non stop during 8 hours.
      </div>

      <div style="margin-top:20px; color:#D0000C;padding-bottom:20px;"> Savings </div>

      <div>
        So how much are we saving? The graph below displays our forecast and actuals after the new roof was installed.
        See the difference between the two lines? That's how much we are saving.
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: center;">
        <img src="img/savings.svg"></img>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Another way to represent is whether we are <span style="background-color: #ff6300; padding: 0px 5px;
        border-radius: 4px; color: white; font-weight: 400;">above</span> or <span style="background-color: #89119c; padding: 0px 5px;
        border-radius: 4px; color: white; font-weight: 400;">below</span> the forecast on a given day (thank
        you <a
          href="https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/whats-different-timeseries-forecast-performance?collection=@observablehq/analyzing-time-series-data">Observable</a>
        team for the inspiration). On average we are saving 20kwh of daily heating energy or a 35% reduction in energy
        usage.
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;">
        <img src="img/savings_2.svg"></img>
      </div>
      <div style="margin-top: 20px;">
        Since Oct 01, 2021 we have saved 2,300 kwh, equivalent to 720 kg CO2e (assuming a <a
          href="https://www.carbonindependent.org/15.html">0.3g of CO2e per Kwh</a> of heating gas). At current
        trend, we would save 5,200 kwh, equivalent to 1,600 kg CO2e until Apr 15, 2022. To put that number in
        perspective, a French emits about 9,000 kg of CO2e per year. Not bad for a roof.

        I had a lot of fun running that analysis and I am inspired by the impact. Energy used in buildings makes about
        <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector">18% of Global Grenhouse Gas emissions</a>.
